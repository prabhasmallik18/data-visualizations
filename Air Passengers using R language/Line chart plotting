✈️ Air Passengers Data Visualization using R

📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the Air Passengers dataset in R using a line chart to understand how the number of air passengers has increased over a given time period.

📁 Dataset Information

Dataset Name: Air Passengers
Data Type: Time series data
Time Period: 1949 to 1960
Frequency: Monthly

Description:
This dataset contains the monthly total number of international airline passengers. It helps in understanding long-term trends and seasonal patterns in air travel.

🛠️ Tools Used

R Programming Language
Built-in AirPassengers dataset in R

📊 Visualization Description

A line chart is used to represent the data.
X-axis: Time period (years)
Y-axis: Number of air passengers
Each point represents passenger count for a month.

📈 Observations

Clear increasing trend over time.
Seasonal peaks every year.
Rapid growth after mid-1950s.

✅ Conclusion

Air passenger traffic steadily increased from 1949 to 1960 due to growth of aviation and seasonal demand.
